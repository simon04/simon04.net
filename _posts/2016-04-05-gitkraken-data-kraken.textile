title: GitKraken – data kraken – Yet another application that tracks you?
published: true
---

**tl;dr**: GitKraken does not check certificate for <code>api.gitkraken.com</code>, and submits an ID plus some usage statistics on every start.

<hr>

Today, I was excited to try the just released "GitKraken":https://blog.axosoft.com/2016/03/29/axosoft-gitkraken-v1/. After installing the "AUR package":https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gitkraken/ (1.0.0-1) and launching the application, I was immediately asked to register. I entered some nonsense email and name and followed the tour.

GitKraken soon listed all my Git repository on my computer which is a cool feature. But I also got a bit suspicious: it could easily aggregate the repository names, submit it and link it to the registered user.

I decided to investigate the network traffic using "mitmproxy":https://mitmproxy.org/. The challenge was to obtain the GitKraken traffic. Since I could not find a proxy configuration within GitKraken. I followed "this tutorial":https://www.darkcoding.net/software/decrypt-your-https-traffic-with-mitmproxy/ to configure mitmproxy in the "Transparent Proxy" mode. I did not install the CA, though.

h2. Registering

I registered in the application …

… a observed a request to <code>https://api.gitkraken.com/register</code>:
"!/img/2016/04/gitkraken-register-net1.png!":/img/2016/04/gitkraken-register-net1.png

The server generates an <code>id</code> which is used for subsequent requests:
"!/img/2016/04/gitkraken-register-net2.png!":/img/2016/04/gitkraken-register-net2.png

But, wait! Mitmproxy intercepts the HTTPS traffic and encrypts it again using its own certificate, which I did not trust. This is what Chromium showed while my traffic was going through mitmproxy:

This means that **GitKraken does accept any certificate for api.gitkraken.com**!

h2. Confirmation

I clicked on the confirmation link sent via email (<code>https://api.gitkraken.com/activate/d810cfe7-c828-47af-860f-9e71cbd68ded/0746…</code>, note the <code>id</code> from above). The application makes a request to <code>https://api.gitkraken.com/phone-home</code> to check the registration status:
"!/img/2016/04/gitkraken-registercheck-net1.png!":/img/2016/04/gitkraken-registercheck-net1.png
"!/img/2016/04/gitkraken-registercheck-net2.png!":/img/2016/04/gitkraken-registercheck-net2.png

h2. Application start

After every start of the application, <code>https://api.gitkraken.com/phone-home</code> is requested again. Besides re-checking the activation status this aims at submitting usage/timing statistics, of course together with the <code>id</code>:
"!/img/2016/04/gitkraken-appstart-net1.png!":/img/2016/04/gitkraken-appstart-net1.png
"!/img/2016/04/gitkraken-appstart-net2.png!":/img/2016/04/gitkraken-appstart-net2.png

h2. Summary

You can man-in-the-middle <code>api.gitkraken.com</code> and obtain usage/timing statistics every time the user opens GitKraken.
