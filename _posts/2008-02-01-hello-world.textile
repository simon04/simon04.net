Welcome visitors to my blog!

One week after setting up this system and thinking whether to start writing, today I finally managed to do so ;-).

First of all currently you'll find more information about me on my personal homepage, reachable under "http:/simon04.net/":http:/simon04.net/. I'm looking forward seeing you to drop in.

What can you expect on this page (the blog)? First of all my intention is to share interesting things regarding computer (science) as I'm currently studying this subject.

Secondary I'll try to write each post in english and therefore you certainly will find loads of errors since english isn't my native language ... ;-)

All further things are expected to turn out themselves after some times ^^

Cheers
Simon
