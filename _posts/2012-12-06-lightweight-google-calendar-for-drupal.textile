title: Lightweight Google Calendar for Drupal
published: true
---
Today, I needed to integrate a lightweight and configurable calendar in a Drupal 6 page. The calendar entries should be obtained from a (public) Google calendar automatically. I ended up with the Drupal modules "gcal_events":https://drupal.org/project/gcal_events and "insert_block":https://drupal.org/project/insert_block. Here's what I did:

# Download the two modules, apply the patch from "373071":https://drupal.org/node/373071 in order to obtain localized month names, obtained the needed "simplepie.inc":http://dev.simplepie.org/SimplePie.compiled.php (to go into @/modules/gcal_events/simplepie.inc@)
# Upload to webserver (as well as create a writeable directory @/module/gcal_events/cache@)
# Enable the modules in @/admin/build/modules@
# Edit calendar block as needed: @/admin/build/block/configure/gcal_events/0@
# Add _insert block filter_ to a filter of choice (@/admin/settings/filters@)
# Create a page @/node/add/page@, insert @[block:gcal_events=0]@ as content (select filter from previous step)
# When using caching, exclude page from previous step using module "cacheexclude":https://drupal.org/project/cacheexclude (@/admin/settings/cacheexclude@)
# Done :-)

The result is currently visible as a demo page under "http://martinmallaun.com/kalender":http://martinmallaun.com/kalender.
