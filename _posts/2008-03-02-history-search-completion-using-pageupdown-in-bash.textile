The Bash-shell stores a history of your last commands. Entering <code>history</code> will display all recently used commands identifying them by an id which lets you access them by entering <code>![id]</code>. This is a nice feature, but unhandy: you can't easily edit the command before being executed and furthermore to find the appropriate id you have to look through the whole list or use <code>grep</code>.

Bash offers a feature which could be called *history search auto completion*. Just enter the first letters of the command and use [PageUp] and [PageDown] to browse through recently used commands matching exactly the part you already entered.

To do so create/edit the file <code>.inputrc</code> in your home folder and insert the following two lines. Alternatively you could edit the <code>/etc/inputrc</code> which would let the changes effect in global scope.

<pre><code>
"e[5~": history-search-backward
"e[6~": history-search-forward
</code></pre>

Cheers
