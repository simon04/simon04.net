Today, I successfully updated the firmware of some TK202 GPS/GPRS trackers, labelled _simtrace TK202_, bought in 2009 or so.

Here's what I did:

# Get a USB cable, I used "this one":http://www.itakka.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1&products_id=1
# Install latest "PL-2303 driver from prolificusa.com":http://prolificusa.com/pl-2303hx-drivers/
# Obtain firmware for _TK102 (Ohne SD Kartenslot)_ from "yourgps.de":http://www.yourgps.de/content/de/Downloads/Firmwares
# Extract archive
# Follow instructions from the enclosed document.

This screenshot summarizes the procedure:

Afterwards, the GPRS transmission was working nicely. In particular, I was no longer getting a @APN failed!@ after sending an @apnuser123456@/@apnpasswd123456@ command.

To test the GPRS transmission, you might find "GPS Device Unique ID Checker":http://id.wialon.net/ helpful.
