title: Force Firefox 3.0 to install Extension
published: true
---
Hello,

there are several older add-ons hanging around there which don't support Firefox 3.0 officially. Therefore Firefox quits the installation on 2 reasons:

<pre><code>... could not be installed because it is not compatible with Firefox ...
... will not be installed because it does not provide secure updates.</code></pre>

To fix these problems add a new boolean value in the "about:config":about:config's table and set the value to be @false@ each.

Cheers,
Simon
