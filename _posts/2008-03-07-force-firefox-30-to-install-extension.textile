Hello,

there are several older add-ons hanging around there which don't support Firefox 3.0 officially. Therefore Firefox quits the installation on 2 reasons:

<code>... could not be installed because it is not compatible with Firefox ... </code>
<code>... will not be installed because it does not provide secure updates.</code>

To fix these problems add a new boolean value in the "about:config":about:config's table and set the value to be <code>false</code> each.

* "extensions.checkUpdateSecurity ":http://kb.mozillazine.org/Extensions.checkUpdateSecurity

Cheers,
Simon
