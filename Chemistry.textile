My interest in chemistry has its beginnings – in fact quite late – at the age of 14. At that time I spontaneously decided to attend chemical exercises (__Chemische Übungen__) in addition to the chemistry classes. On the one hand, one could conduct chemical experiments on your own – on the other hand, I was interested in theoretical explanations and justifications for chemical phenomena.

In high school, I attended the optional subject "Chemistry Olympiad":http://www.oecho.at/. As the name suggests, competitions take place every year. There are several qualification stages: course competitions – state competitions – national competitions – International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO). In the summer of 2006 I had the possibility to participate at the "IChO in Korea":http://icho2006.kcsnet.or.kr/ after reaching the 4th rank in the national competition.
